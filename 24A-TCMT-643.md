We have discussed that you would like to add some new content to M8, M10, and M13, which will convert to ~20 minutes of new lecture videos for these modules.  This is just a rough estimate.

Mike will upload materials around January 1stÂ 2024.

Please use this link to upload new materials:

[Google Drive / METM Program Chunk Box / 24A-TCMT-643](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q54kwSXkJub_Ik88dm2bO1Ni4_rCbTiR)

- As of 2024-01-03 no content has been added to the Google Drive folder.
