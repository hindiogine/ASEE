## Paper Title
Perceptions on the Effectiveness of Using Generative AI and Voice Cloning to Aid in the Development of Online Course Materials

## The Research Questions
1. The ability of Generative-AI to comprehend languages and generate human-like text makes it an excellent candidate to assist in content development efforts.
2. Emerging capabilities in voice cloning technology provide new options for creating instructional audio and video components.
3. It is imperative to carefully analyze the efficacy of these tools to inform future decisions and address any academic concerns of both faculty and students.
	1. Efficacy of using any any new tool, particularly AI
	2. Concerns of faculty and students in the use of these tools

## Q1 "AI-generated development of instructional content"

Creative Applications of Generative Models in Academic Course Content Creation

Many papers on the use of Generative-AI in the production of lessons plans and outlines.  Few papers on generation of content.

#### [[Dang, et al., 2022]]
**Findings**: Prompting a generative model enables end-users, including instructors, to creatively leverage zero-shot and few-shot learning to assign new tasks to an AI ad-hoc, potentially in academic course content creation.

#### [[Mishra, et al., 2023]]
**Findings**: Our AI-based approach automatically generates short videos for online educational courses, reducing time-consuming human efforts and increasing interest among learners.

#### [[Ruiz-Rojas, et al., 2023]]
**Findings**: The study concludes that generative artificial intelligence tools have significant potential in education. They provide innovative ways to engage students, adapt content, and promote personalized learning.

#### [[Schroeder et al., 2022]]
**Findings**: The AI-generated courseware was beneficial to instructors first in that courseware for these niche titles did not exist previously, but second in that the automatically generated questions allowed them to spend their development time on targeted adaptivity. Years of teaching experience give faculty members unparalleled insight into where and how students struggle with content, and both instructors were able to apply their knowledge to tailor the courseware.

#### [[Leiker et al., 2023]]
**Findings**: These findings suggest that AI-generated learning videos have the potential to be a viable substitute for videos produced via traditional methods in online educational settings, making high quality educational content more accessible across the globe.

#### [[Ruedian and Niels, 2023]]
**Findings**:  (waiting on the library)


## Q2 "Create instructional videos and audio using voice cloning technology"

#### [[Leiker et al., 2023]]
**Findings**: These findings suggest that AI-generated learning videos have the potential to be a viable substitute for videos produced via traditional methods in online educational settings, making high quality educational content more accessible across the globe.
