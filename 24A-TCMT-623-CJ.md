The focus should be CJ’s transcripts for all modules 1-3 and video fixes and other videos pending to be created.

CJ has reviewed all the lectures in Module 1-3 (except for the three below I just uploaded to YouTube) and she has marked in [Column M in the course map](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qjJUKxTs594yoH4nHpgDctNjyLPsHV_F0btgWYdUGwY/edit#gid=47199416) in Red color which lecture needs to be fixed and what to fix.

Could you assign these fixes as the highest priority and let us know what timeline to expect?


- [ ] L8. "Want collaboration?" is not created yet. 

See [folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1C-okMHbQbsIEsQMiLAzs8BIsZHqRwE6U&usp=drive_fs)

So L8, 13,20,28 for Modules 1-3.

- [ ] M3L32, 33 and 34 do not have the correct thumbnails. Could you please create them and share with me?

- [ ] We are missing L13,20,28 in the first three modules, CJ already submitted the materials. Please make a note to have higher priorities for these three videos.
